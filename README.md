# VandyHacks2017

Hey guys,
  this is the Unino university Hack-a-thon project for Vandy Hacks 2017. 
  
Our Goal:
-creat a virtual environment that has random occurrences that could occur each incrament of time. We will hopefully display on a website      or on a virtual reality display what occurs at a set incrament of time. 
-This website is planning on using THREE.js and templates imported from blender. 


Potiential Problems we will need to overcome:
  -Using Blender or THREE.js to inovate our animations
  -how and where to ask the user how long we should simulate over what amount of time
  -what enviornment(s) should we do and create
  
  
  
Things to be to to inclue in envornment: 
  -flatplane or someshape 
    - look into perlanoise
  -water
    -randomizing x,y,z coordinates
    -shape & size of the water
  -elivation
    -how that will effect the water flow
    -if above a certian altitude threaten life, snow, & civilazation
  -civilazation
    - # of people (both male and famale)
  - natureal animals in the envornment
    - animals movement in relation to food & water
    -hibernation
    -growth of packs
  -vegitations
    -different types of plants that can grow
    -vegitation that can grow, and if it is edible
    - different seasons that could grow.
